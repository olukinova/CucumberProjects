Hooks are made for defining pre- and post-conditions in any cucumber framework
(similar to annotations in TestNG)
Hooks is a class and is always created inside the StepDefinition Folder
This class cannot be inherited (!)
For instance @Before (io.cucumber), @After (io.cucumber)

HOOKS are always executed first!!!
Then they are followed by background keyword
Then Scenario steps are executed
And the last hooks with annotation @After are executed

Maven life cycle consists of several phases:

1. Clean
Removes all the files generated by the previous build
It basically cleans the target folder
Target folder will reappear when you run your test cases again
2. Validate
It checks the project is correct and all necessary info is available
Mostly used by Devs
3. Compile
Compiles tho source code of the project
4. Test
Runs the tests for the project
Compile + Clean + Validate are executed behind the scene
5. Package
Packages compiled code into a distributable format, such as JAR or WAR files
6. Verify
It runs and check on result of integration tests to ensure quality criteria is met
7. Install
Installs the packages into local repositories
Everytime we add dependencies into pom.xml they are downloaded in our system as well.
Dependencies are stored in the folder called ".m2". This folder has a repo with all dependencies.
THIS QUESTION IS VERY FREQUENTLY ASKED DURING THE INTERVIEW
8. Site
Generates documentation for the project
9. Deploy
Copies thi final package to remote repo for sharing with other Devs

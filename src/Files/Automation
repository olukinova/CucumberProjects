Which things we need to automate backend:
- address of the database;
- proper name of a database;
- access to the database (user credentials)

Connection class - to establish connection to DB
Make a statement - it allows us to send the query to the DB
Resultest - the result will be stored in this object
rset.next() - to shift the cursor on to the next line
Resultmetadata - it will give you the information of the entire result such as
how many columns are there, how many rows are there, names of columns, names of rows etc.

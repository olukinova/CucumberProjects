***Data-Driven Testing in Cucumber***

This is very often required in any automated test to pass data or to use the same test again with
different data set. And the good part is that the Cucumber inherently supports Data Driven Testing
using Scenario Outline. There are different ways to use the data insertion within the Cucumber and
outside the Cucumber with external files.

1. Parameterization without Example Keyword - Cucumber expression
Data-Driven Testing in Cucumber using Scenario Outline
DrawBacks: changes need to be done in java file

2. Parameterization with Example Keyword using scenario outline (Need to update the Statement in the feature file, which
tells Cucumber to enter username & Password)
This uses Example keyword to define the test data for the Scenario
This works for the whole test
Cucumber automatically run the complete test the number of times equal to the number of data
in the Test Set


3. Parameterization using data Tables
Drawbacks: you need to update java file with for loop to run each step
No keyword is used to define the test data
This works only for the single step, below which it is defined

4. Data-Driven Testing in Cucumber using External Files
Parameterization using Excel Files
Parameterization using Json
Parameterization using XML

Scenario Outline - This is used to run the same scenario for 2 or more different sets of test data.
E.g. In our scenario, if you want to register another user you can data drive the same scenario twice.

Examples - All scenario outlines have to be followed with the Examples section.
This contains the data that has to be passed on to the scenario.

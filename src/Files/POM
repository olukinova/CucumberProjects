Page object model is an object repository
POM stores or holds all the web elements specific to a particular page

1. Every Page object class should extend CommonMethods class
2. Define Web Elements (they should be public) using P@FindBy annotation
3. Initialize all web elements by creating a public constructor on the current page (PageFactory)

In a step definition file you have to create object of this Page Object class

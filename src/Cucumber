Components of Cucumber:
- Features file (responsible for supporting BDD components with the help of Gherkin language)
- Step Definition (here we write a corresponding code)
- Test Runner

Options:
1. features - maps where feature files are located in our framework
2. glue - maps where class files are located in our framework
3. dryRun = true - checks for every step in feature file, corresponding code is written or not; if not,
it will autogenerate the missing piece of code, BUT test cases will not execute!!!!
4. dryRun = false - in this case test cases will be executed
